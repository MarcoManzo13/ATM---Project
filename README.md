# ATM - Project
This first project is to practice my C++ skills. I do believe it to be foolproof, even though that's never a good thing to say. 
It has only 4 options. It is a small step into my C++ Mastership in the future so enjoy!
I know it may be quite obvious but no real money is getting deposited, withdrawn or displayed. :)
